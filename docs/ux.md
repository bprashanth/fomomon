# FOMO App ux mods 

Focus on repeatability and ease for a 20 year timeline. 

## Pipeline 

1. Pipeline with stages to reduce choice/error
2. Take both 

## Ghost images 

1. Rule of Thirds Overlay
2. Ghost Alignment Feedback
3. Aspect Ratio Tuning (?)
4. Portrait Mode Support (currently same image used in both) 
5. Minimize Camera UI Clutter
6. Camera Button Optimization (save/swap is confusing) 
	
## Location 

1. Map vs proximity
	- "you're within 5m of the station" 
	- feedback when user has reached station stone
2. Bearing/Compass Integration
	- compass overlay showing direction to the station (?)
	- Display “go NW” hints: which way to look? 
3. Error and manual filling of gps coords? 


## Planned 

1. Station creation 
2. Data ingestion
