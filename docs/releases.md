# Releases 

This is an index document. See the following for contents     

1. [app store](../docs/releases.md): this document has various details like
   signing keys, app fqdns and app versioning. 
2. [release channels](../docs/release_channels.md): this document outlines
   the release methodology. The Android app store allows one to upload
pre-finished versions of apps to different groups of testers, and to
produce a build for a specific group, we need a specific build command. 
3. Apple App Store: in the future, there will be a third doc outlining the
   android app store policies etc.
